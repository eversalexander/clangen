- Population explosion prevention:
  - Litters are less frequent
      - 10% less likely for cats with mates
      - 36% less likely for cats without mates
      - 33% less likely overall in clans > 30 members

    - 45% chance 2 kits

    - 10% chance 4 kits
  - Elders may die of old age starting at 120 moons; death roll occurs every moon past 150
  - Old age death roll chance increased from 16.67% to 25%
  
- Traditional-esque naming
  - Unusual prefixes and suffixes removed
    - Chosen by my own preference, YMMV on what is "unusual"
  - Some prefixes and kittypet/loner names added
  - Kittypets and loners always take suffix when joining clan
  - Kittypet/loner names incompatible with naming system (i.e. containing spaces or apostrophes) removed
